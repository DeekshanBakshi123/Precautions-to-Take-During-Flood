Personal Health and Safety Precautions After the Flood


It takes a while before your life gets back to normal after the flood has receded. However, there are certain safety measures you have to take immediately after the flood to avoid falling ill.


Check out the below tips that you can follow after a flood.



• If you own a well or there is one in your locality, avoid drinking water from it. It may have been contaminated during the flood and can cause serious illness.


• When there is stagnant floodwater, it becomes the favourite breeding place for mosquitoes. So, make sure to get the stagnant water removed from your surroundings.


• Make sure to use mosquito repellant for a few days after the flood recedes.


• If you notice that your refrigerator was flooded too, throw away all the food items stored and avoid consuming anything that was stored anywhere in your home before the flood.


• If you have been cleaning your home and came in contact with floodwater, wash your hands thoroughly with soap before you touch your face.


• If you suffer any wound, during the flood, that is swollen and painful or has a foreign object (metal, glass pieces, soil), get medical help immediately.


• Do not eat raw vegetables and fruits from your farm or garden if it was submerged in floodwater.
• Drink only boiled water and eat only those food items that are prepared cautiously.


• Discard all the damaged items from your home like screens, carpets, mattresses, pillows, etc.


• In case you have electricity problems, do not try to repair it yourself. Call an electrician to get it fixed.


• If you have many wet items at home, dry them by placing them under the sun when the weather is good.


• Your walls and ceilings may be wet and eventually become home for molds. To avoid this, make a solution of bleaching powder and apply it on the walls.


How is Flood Water Dangerous to Human Health?



Both standing and running floodwater is dangerous to humans in many ways. They can harm humans by causing various medical conditions.


• This water may displace animals, reptiles, and insects. They may inflict infectious bites on humans.


• Floodwater can also bring hazardous chemicals, carcinogenic substances, and even human waste. These may pose a danger to human health.


• Sharp objects that the floodwater contains may injure you.


• Broken power lines can surge electrical charge through floodwater that may electrocute you.
• If you are stuck in floodwater for too long, you may get Trench Foot, where your legs go numb, blotchy, and painful.


• Floodwater is also capable of causing many diseases in humans.


Some Diseases Caused Due to Flood Water



In India, we can see people suffering from various water-borne and vector-borne diseases after a flood. Coming in contact with or drinking polluted water can be the reason. On the other hand, a bite from an infectant-bearing vector such as mosquito can cause severe illness. We have listed some of the common communicable diseases that you must be aware of.

To Conclude,
Flood not only impacts the economy of the affected region but also the health of the affected people. We have seen how the 2019 rainfall has ripped through parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka causing huge loss. Just when we are breathing a sigh of relief, owing to the receding floods, another bout of the devastating flood is hitting the coastal areas of Karnataka and Kerala. This has not only caused a lot of damage to the infrastructure but also has taken several lives.
The main reason for floods in India is poor or inadequate drainage capacity of rivers, high-intensity rainfall in short duration, failure of flood control structures, and unplanned reservoir regulation.
While our government works on the issues that lead to deadly floods in the nation, let us follow these safety precautions and take care of each other’s health.
